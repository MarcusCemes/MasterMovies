Welcome to the open-source repository for the MasterMovies domain. Feel free to explore the inner workings of the website and see if you can find a way to break it!

This repository may be forced-pushed at any time.


## Getting Started

The repository is a self-contained package that allows you to install required dependencies with npm, and build your own local copy to try out.

MasterMovies is a build with Gatsby, a static website generator. Content is "server side rendered" at build time with React, even providing some support for non-JS users, but mainly providing a faster initial load-time. All the client has to do is hydrate the React bindings on the page.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (+npm)

## Install, Build and Launch

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Build the website
4. Serve it!

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MarcusCemes/mastermovies-api.git
$ npm ci
$ npm run develop # Edit with hot-reloading
$ npm run build   # Build static website files
$ npm run serve   # Serve the website like Apache/Nginx would
```
